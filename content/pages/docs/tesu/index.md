Thomas Edison State University is a unique college in that it offers a very generous credit transfer policy, and with very low residency requirements (classes taken at TESU). It only mandates two courses to be taken at TESU in order to graduate: the Cornerstone and the Capstone.

This section describes the best strategy for enrollment.

## Apply

The first step is to apply for TESU as an undergraduate applicant. You'll want to gather all your previous transcripts, as they get submitted as part of the process. The application fee is $50.

  <strong>Note:</strong> 
  Due to in-state tuition discounts, it may be worth it to wait to apply until you have established residency in New Jersey if a move seems close.

## Enrollment

Applying is different than enrollment. The application process does not automatically enroll you as a student and provide you with the full benefits of a student. You are in application status until you enroll or until 12 months have passed from your application date (at which point you'll be put into inactive status); whichever comes first. Those who are in application status are only entitled to 2 transcript evaluations. Being fully enrolled unlocks the following benefits:

+ **Unlimited evaluation of any transcripts you might send in.** Transcripts can take a long time to arrive and you might use up your two "free" evaluations before any mailed-in transcripts are able to get to TESU.

+ **Access to EBSCOhost** - a research platform that will be useful for finding academic sources for the papers you write at SDC and elsewhere

+ **Access to ProQuest** - another research platform that is similar to, but different than, EBSCOhost

+ **Access to the New Jersy State Library research library** - TESU students have access to electronic resources no matter where they might be located in the world.

## The One Trick TESU Doesn't Want You to Know

Once your application has been approved, you have to sign up for a class in order to be enrolled. But since the savvy students are taking almost all of their classes elsewhere, they use a pro tip in order to achieve enrollment status without registering. They sign up to take a TECEP exam.

A TECEP is like TESU's version of a CLEP test. By signing up for one, the student is considered enrolled at the school. The cheapest TECEP is a one-credit exam for _Medical Terminology_ (weird, I know). Here is how it works:

+ Sign up for the Medical Terminology TECEP
+ Because it grants only 1 credit, it is just $50.
+ You don't ever have to actually take the exam.
+ You can drop it from your class list as soon as you become fully enrolled.
+ The TECEP will **not** show up on your transcript and will not bring your GPA down.

Once you are fully enrolled, your **enrollment status lasts for 12 months**. At this point, you will either need to repeat the process again or graduate.
