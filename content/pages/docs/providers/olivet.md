## General Information

Through their [YourWay Program](https://online.olivet.edu/yourway), Olivet Nazarene University offers a number of self-paced classes for $50 per credit (as of January 2021). Unlike many other credit options, you pay for your class _after_ you are done and not before you have started.

There is no fee for applying to the program but you must provide proof of graduation in order to be accepted.

## Course Structure

Each class is broken up into different modules and each module is broken down into different units. Each unit has an estimated time to completion but these may not take into account the external reading and almost certainly don't take into account the time needed to complete the required assignments. In addition to readings, there are also videos most/all units.

At the end of each unit, there is a Trailhead/Salesforce quiz. These are similar to the Study.com quizzes. But, if you get everything right on the first try, you get 100 points. Second attempt, 50 points. Subsequent attempts, 25 points. For ONU classes, these points seem to be there mainly to track your progress because they don't appear to have any bearing on your grade. In addition to the quiz, there is also an easily-missed link to an assignment that must be completed. These may be multiple-choice tests. These may be written assessments. It depends on the class. These assignments are graded.

Although self-paced, ONU courses contain at least as much work as any RA option. Students should not expect to accelerate through these classes in the same way that one may accelerate through courses from institutions like Study.com or Sophia.org.
