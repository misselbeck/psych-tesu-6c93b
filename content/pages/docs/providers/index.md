## Sophia.org

<a href="https://www.sophia.org/online-courses/all-courses/" target="_blank">Direct Link</a>

Sophia is currently the fastest and cheapest way to fulfill most of your General Education requirements for TESU. If you take every course at Sophia, you should have somewhere between 70 and 86 credits towards your degree. Most courses consist of readings followed by quizzes and larger tests (challenges and milestones respectively). There may be videos in some courses. Some courses also have essays or video assignments (known as touchstones). Your final grade is based on all of these and not just a single final exam.

_Cost: Subscription at $79 per month; no limit to courses taken within that time period. Does not use traditional proctoring methods; no cost for proctoring._

## Olivet Nazarene University

<a href="https://online.olivet.edu/yourway" target="_blank">Direct Link</a>

In 2021, TESU threw alt-college students a curveball by requiring that 24 credits come from regionally accredited universities. Not willing to be thwarted, a group of home school moms found that Olivet is a cheap source of these credits, and shared this info with the DegreeInfo group.

While not as easy to breeze through as some providers, classes taken online at Olivet are fairly cheap, and most importantly, all count toward that 24 accrediation number.

You will likely need to take at least 3 courses here.

_Cost: $50 per credit, making most courses cost $150 total._

## InstantCert.com

<a href="https://www.instantcert.com/" target="_blank">Direct Link</a>

InstantCert offers a handful of ACE-approved courses for a low cost. These include American Government (which fills in the remaining General Education slot that Sophia does not cover). The final grade/credit is based on a single pass/fail exam.

You will likely only need one course from this provider.

_Cost: Suscription at $20 per month; + $15 proctor fee; 1 course included per month._

## Study.com

<a href="http://study.com/" target="_blank">Direct Link</a>

Study.com (or SDC) has a large number of ACE or NCCRS approved exams. This includes many UL (upper-level) credits that cannot be found elsewhere or that cost much more to take elsewhere. See the SDC page for tips and tricks on how to make the most out of your membership. It is currently possible to complete most of several degrees using only Sophia and SDC courses, making this an invaluable source of credits.

_Cost: Suscription at $199 per month; allows for 2 exams during that month. Additional exams can be unlocked for $70. You may pay for an additional 3 exams per billing period for a total of 5 exams in any given billing period._

## Coopersmith

<a href="https://www.coopersmithcc.net/shop/" target="_blank">Direct Link</a>

Courses at Coopersmith generally consist of a number of modules that contain videos and a practice test. There is also a final exam review and the proctored final exam. Whether you pass the course or not depends entirely on the score you receive on the final exam. You need to get 70% to pass the exam.

 They are a good source of several important UL credit options.

_Cost: $50 per credit, making most courses cost $150 total._
