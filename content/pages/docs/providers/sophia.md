## Sign-up Information

When signing up to take courses at Sophia, it is important that you **do not** fill in the optional information regarding which school that you plan to attend. If you do this, Sophia will give you a school-specific account that will not give you full access to everything that Sophia has to offer. They will only show you the classes that they know will work with a given institution and Sophia's information may be get outdated For these reasons, you are going to want to have a _generic_ Sophia account.

Once you have signed up, you should also refrain from filling in the optional information regarding which institution you plan to transfer an individual course to or else they may again place you into a school-specific account.

## Course-Taking Strategy

Some Sophia courses have things called "Touchstones" which are assignments that you must turn in to receive a grade. At times, these can take the full 60 days to complete as a result of the delays in grading times. There are currently 5 relevant courses with touchstones at Sophia. 

Because you may only have 2 courses active at any one time, a good strategy is to have only one course with touchstones at any one time. This will allow you to work on the other courses while waiting for your grades/feedback to be posted so that you may continue on with the work. For instance, you might choose to work on the history courses while waiting to get your essays for English Composition I returned.

#### Courses with Touchstones
+ English Composition I
+ English Composition II
+ Public Speaking
+ Business Law
+ Communication at Work

### Course Order

For the most part, the order of Sophia courses does not matter. For instance, it doesn't matter if you take US History I before or after US History II. There are a few notable exceptions when you are trying to maximize your Sophia experience.

+ Developing Effective Teams, Project Management, The Essentials of Managing Conflict, and Conflict Resolution are inter-related and have some overlap with one another. By taking these courses one after another, you'll need to spend less time reading/studying. Suggested order: 1.) The Essentials of Managing Conflict 2.) Conflict Resolution 3.) Developing Effective Teams 4.) Project Management

+ Macroeconomics should not be taken until after taking Microeconomics. Concepts are introduced in Microeconomics that are expanded upon in Macroeconomics. It is still possible to pass if they are not taken in this order but it may be more difficult than anticipated.

+ Introduction to Ethics is more of a philosophy class. Ancient Greek Philosophers should be taken first.

+ There is some overlap of basic concepts between Ethics, Introduction to Psychology, and Introduction to Sociology. The order doesn't matter, so long as Ancient Greek Philosophers comes before Ethics.

## Course Structure

Courses at Sophia generally consist of units that are divided into sections called challenges. As you progress through the challenges, you must answer questions based on the material presented in that section. The material may be in the form of text, videos, or audio depending on the course in question. Once you have successfully completed all of the challenges in a unit, you may take the "milestone" or chapter/unit quiz. The English Composition, Business Law, College Readiness, and Public Speaking courses also have additional assignments - called Touchstones - that you must turn in to receive a grade.

Some courses have a different layout than other courses. These can be divided into the old style and the new style. With the old style, you get three chances to answer one question correctly. With the new style, you get one chance to answer one of three questions correctly. The new style layout is often both easier and more conducive to learning because you're given an extra opportunity to retain and digest the material if you didn't understand the initial question.

In order to get credit for a given course, you must have an overall grade of 70% or more.
