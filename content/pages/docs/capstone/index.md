TESU requires a capstone class in order to graduate with a bachelor's degree. This class is designed to be an intensive research study program that requires the student to integrate knowledge learned from throughout the student's undergraduate studies.

This page attempts to gather some information about the capstone, including student insights, into one location.

## Overview

Each discipline (e.g. science, liberal arts, professional studies, business administration) requires a capstone. The Psych program requires the Liberal Arts Capstone (LIB-495). Each capstone requires a research project completed by the student.

The liberal arts capstone can be considered similar to an independent study course with a thesis requirement -- students select their own topic with approval of the instructor, research the topic independently, and write a research paper (thesis) one chapter at a time over the course of the semester. This will require the student to self-select a topic of choice, narrow the scope to one that is broad enough to be interesting but focused enough to be covered in a single paper, construct a major research question and 3-4 supporting questions, and follow a specific format for the paper.

## Capstone Structure

Over the course of 12 weeks the student will identify a topic and research questions, and upon approval of the instructor will write a five-chapter research paper consisting of the following:

+ An introduction defining the research topic and research questions.
+ A literature review, showing the student has thoroughly researched existing literature that gives background information on each research question.
+ A methodology chapter, showing how the student plans to actually address each research question.
+ A results chapter, showing the student has performed the study and reports the findings.
+ A discussion chapter, in which the student synthesizes the information from the results, shows how the results address the research questions and derives new knowledge from the findings.
+ Capstone papers may be quantitative or qualitative, but most are expected to be qualitative in nature. They may include surveys, or may largely consist of reviewing existing literature and drawing conclusions. In that sense, the capstone project can be considered a significantly larger and more structured version of the typical undergraduate research paper.

Several mentors will provide example papers from previous students as guidelines to follow.

## Choosing a Topic

Many students are stressed and confused regarding the topic they should choose. One suggestion given above is to treat the course as an independent study semester. Another suggestion, which appears to be endorsed (and even expected) by the capstone e-book, is to consider some form of research project that ties into one's current job or current or future career. For example, if a student works in a non-profit supporting the local community they may choose to research the impact of a particular program impacts a particular segment of the community, e.g. how an educational support program for elementary schools impacts student grades during a particular period. Such a topic is large enough to be interesting but focused enough to be approachable.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Students generally are not restricted in the topics they can select. If a student in a science program wants to conduct history research or a creative writing project, generally it is perfectly acceptable as long as the student can justify how the topic is relevant to the student's personal goals. Be sure to check with the instructor.

## Liberal Arts Capstone Example Topics

The following list of example topics were provided by Dr. James Cody during a LIB-495 class. Note that these are high-level topics -- actual papers will ask and answer specific research questions within a particular topic. Also note that these topics were all identified by students -- there is no list of topics from which the student is expected to choose. These are only examples meant to guide students in how to think about their project.
