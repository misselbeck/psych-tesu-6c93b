## The Roadmap

+ Sign up for a subscription at an online course provider and start completing online classes
+ After completing the General Education Requirements, target major-specific courses using online providers to earn upper-level credits
+ Fill in the rest of your degree with free electives
+ Finally, complete the Business Major courses at UMPI.

It will take some time, but before you know it, you'll have banked up the 120 credits necessary to receive your degree and put any education worries behind you _for good_.
