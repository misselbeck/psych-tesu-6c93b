## The American Council on Education (ACE)

The American Council on Education (ACE) is an organization that works with colleges and universities to grant accreditation. ACE reviews courses and makes a recommendation as to whether or not the course should be accepted by a school for credit.

ACE also provides a transcript service that can be used to collect your various "alternative credits" together in one location for transfer to your chosen school. Simply register through the ACE website, identify courses you have completed, and ACE will verify completion with the course provider(s). Once your transcript is created, simply order your ACE transcript and have it sent to your school of choice for an initial evaluation.

ACE uses the Credly system for sending transcripts to universities and colleges.

## Credly

Starting a Credly account is one of the first steps in the alt-college process. This is the one-stop place for accumulating your credit and providing them to TESU.

Ordering a transcript using the Credly system is completely free. The downside to the process is that there is not any receipt confirmation to know that the receiving institution got your transcript. If you hear nothing for a few weeks, you may need to contact the school in question to confirm that they are actually processing your transcript.

Tips on sending transcripts:
+ Always confirm that this information matches the information that your college/university has. This is especially important if you have a more common name! If they know you as "John Dave Doe", sending a transcript from just "John Doe" may result in your transcript not getting processed.
+ Although entering your birth information is not considered required information by the form, it is highly recommended that you enter this information anyway to help expedite the processing of your transcript.
+ TESU email for receiving is: **transcripts@tesu.edu**
